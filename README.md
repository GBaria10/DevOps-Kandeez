## 📖 Introduction

The **Caput Project** is a cybersecurity simulation tool designed to replicate ransomware behavior in a controlled environment. Built for research and educational purposes, the project enables users to study how ransomware operates and to evaluate various prevention and mitigation strategies. It features **Kandeez-Ransomware**, a lightweight, browser-based simulator developed using JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.
